# Season 0 - draft

{% hint style="info" %}
**DRAFT:** This document is still a work in progress and has not yet been finalized.
{% endhint %}

Welcome to Season 0, the inaugural phase of our revenue-sharing program! This Season marks a pivotal moment in our journey, setting the stage for a new era of community engagement and reward distribution.

During Season 0, **80% of the total revenue will be shared with those who stake and participate**, while the remaining 20% is allocated to overhead costs. This ensures that the majority of rewards goes to those who stake tokens and actively contribute to our ecosystem.

{% hint style="info" %}
**TL;DR**: To earn the highest rewards, stake your tokens and actively participate on the platform.

### Base Reward - 52%

{% hint style="info" %}
52% of the revenue share is distributed to those who stake $WORK.
{% endhint %}

Each user receives rewards based on the amount of WORK they have staked. These rewards are distributed weekly on Fridays, which we refer to as "Payday."

The amount each user can withdraw on Payday is determined by their Loyalty percentage.

**Loyalty Percentage**:

* Each user begins with a loyalty percentage of 5%.
* For every week a user participates—meaning they do not withdraw their stake—their loyalty percentage increases by 15.83%.
* After 6 weeks of continuous participation, a user’s loyalty percentage will reach 100%.'
* Maintaining a 100% Loyalty percentage is essential, as it allows you to withdraw the full remaining amount at the end of the Season.

**Important Notes**:

* If a user withdraws their stake at any time, their loyalty percentage will reset to the starting point of 5%.
* The loyalty percentage remains unaffected by adding more WORK to the stake.
* Users can only withdraw their entire staked amount; partial withdrawals are not allowed.
