# Introduction

## Purpose of GibWork

GibWork serves as a dynamic marketplace where open source project owners, backed by investment, can post development tasks or 'bounties' that require assistance. These bounties are not just tasks; they represent unique opportunities for developers to contribute to meaningful projects while receiving compensation for their skills and effort. It's not a freelance tool, but an opportunity to reward those who truly spent some time adjusting and complementing Github files.



## Target Audience

Our platform is tailored for two primary user groups:

* **Project Owners:** Visionaries and innovators who have open source projects and need additional development resources. GibWork enables them to post bounties, attracting skilled developers to contribute to their projects.
* **Developers:** Talented individuals looking for challenging projects to apply their skills, learn new ones, and earn rewards. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a budding programmer, GibWork offers a plethora of opportunities to contribute to diverse projects.

## Features and Workflow

At GibWork, our workflow is straightforward and developer-friendly. Developers can browse through a list of available bounties, select one that aligns with their skills, and start working by initiating a 'fork' of the project. Contributions are made in a dedicated branch prefixed with "gib-", ensuring that all changes are organized and traceable. Upon completion, developers can submit their work through a pull request via our platform. Successful completion and approval of the work lead to the reward claim process, where developers are compensated in USDC, a stable and reliable cryptocurrency.



## Our Commitment

GibWork is more than just a platform; it's a community committed to the growth and sustainability of open source projects. We are dedicated to providing a transparent, fair, and rewarding environment for all our users. Our platform is constantly evolving, and we value the feedback and contributions from our community to make GibWork the go-to place for open source project collaboration.
